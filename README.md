# MSUScheduleWatcher
A program that will repeatedly search schedule.msu.edu for you, notifying you if your requested classes are available.

When the program is finished, the user will be able to specify classes listed on https://schedule.msu.edu. The program will continually
watch them, and alert the user via text message if a section becomes available. The program will support multiple alerts of any classes,
and will eventually have loadable configs, so that users can quickly setup their alerts whenever they open the program again.

I created this program so I could get into my courses at Michigan State University. At the current time I am a junior, and I can't get into many 
of the classes I absolutely need in order to graduate. Academic advisors dont always have enough time to dedicate to each student, so this program will help students find courses when direct help isn't available.

Personally, class overrides have never worked for me. MSU has an open seat notification system, but you have to get in a queue (which are usually very long, especially for popular classes), and the system only checks every 20 minutes.

I wanted to skip the line, and check more often than the open seat notification system - so I created this program.
